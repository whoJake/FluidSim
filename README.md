# FluidSim Project

Small project inspired by Sebastian Lague's [Fluid Simulation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSKMYc1CQHE)
Really a testing ground to see how well the new graphics backend would work when doing it on an actual project. Not much thought put into the simulation itself but it makes good use of the features and showcases that it works.

Bonus that it provided some nice visuals even if not a well developed fluid simulation. Entire simulation is single threaded but has a form of spatial lookup for fluid particles meaning it can handle a couple thousand particles within 30fps still.
